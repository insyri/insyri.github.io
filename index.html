                <header>About</header>
                <p>I am a 14 year old programmer that resides in Florida, US. I first started to teach myself coding in late 2019 — discord bots, from then I've been using JavaScript and TypeScript mainly; in the short future, I plan to learn more languages such as Rust, C/C++, Lua, Powershell and Python. Currently, most of the things I've created/ am working on are too early in development to be publicized, however, I use GitHub more to help others and paste random stuff I want to see again than it's actual intended use cases... I am no expert at front-end, however, sometimes I jump onto Affinity Designer to create vector art. <br><br> I use Visual Studio Code and Windows 10, I don't have a special reason why I use VSCode, I've just grown with it and I'm not bothered to try anything else, also I don't see how much better another text editor is than another. As for you Linux users who are freaking out and pulling out pitchforks, the same story really, I don't see the benefit in using Linux over Windows in my use cases. I will probably start learning Linux to better my understanding of lower level programming and embedded software. No, I don't know which distribution I will use. <br><br> Intel i7-6700HQ @ 2.60 GHz <br> 8GB of Memory @ 2133 MHz<br> Nvidia GTX 960M [Broken] <br><br> I game, but not as much as I would like to.</p>

                <p>rsource is my next big project; a collection of discord bots for the strafes.net community to use in replacement of other bots and websites to better the user experience for the individual and others. It will also server as a community to help others with understanding of in-game moderation, map-making, and Lua scripting. The first project will be rsource records, this will act as an API interface bot, much like RBhop Dog and Sevbot, coming with additional features and customization. I then plan to make a forum for map-making, the bot also being an API interface; this bot will act essentially as a Stack Overflow using Prisma and MySQL. rsource fun is planned to have no real connection with the game, it will be more of a sub-bot due to its less usefulness; the existence is for my learning.</p>
